Template: pxe-server-installer/service-iface
#Type: [select,multiselect,string,boolean,note,text,password]
Type: select
Choices: eth0, eth1, magic, unicorns
Default: eth0
Description: Which interface shall listen for clients?
 This is the interface which will serve the clients. dhcpd will listen on this interface.
 .
 When I figure out how to do it, this selection list will be prepopulated
 with the actual interfaces detected on the system. Until then, it's magic and unicorns.

Template: pxe-install-server/uplink-iface
Type: select
Choices: eth0, eth1, magic, unicorns
Default: none
Description: Which interface shall connect to the external network?
 This is the interface which will connect to the Internet in order to fetch updates and such.
 .
 This interface will provide http proxy to the clients, so if not configured
 or left default the clients will have no outside network access. It's a feature!
 Also, this choice, like the previous, should become prepopulated and 
 free of unicorn magic.

Template: pxe-install-server/client-arches
Type: multi-select
Choices: i386, amd64, armel, m68k, MOS6502, Bucky Fuller
Default: i386
Description: For which architectures do you wish to install client images?
 Ubuntu supports only i386 and amd64 as of this writing. Debian supports many different architectures. Ideally this choice should be prepopulated from an
 authoritative source.
 If you don't know the answer, choose both i386 and amd64. If you have room for only one, pick i386. Then get more storage.

Template: pxe-install-server/tftp-url
Type: string
Default: http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/trusty/main/installer-$1/current/images/netboot/
Description: Where are the PXE files located?
 We need some files for tftpd to serve our clients that they may boot over the network.
 .
 If you don't know the answer, leave the default and it will download the PXE files from Ubuntu.
 Otherwise, enter the URL of the files.

Template: pxe-install-server/image-url
Type: string
Default: http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/xubuntu/releases/14.04/release/
Description: Where is the image file located?
 Once the clients have begun to boot, we need to provide a live image for them to use.
 .
 If you don't know the answer, leave the default and it will download the image from Ubuntu.
 Otherwise, enter the URL of the files.
