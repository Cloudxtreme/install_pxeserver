This set of scripts installs and configures the necessary packages to make a PXE server.
The server provides unpacked live CD images (that is, read-only file systems) via NFS. By default it's configured to provide Xubuntu Trusty.

The main script is called install-pxe-server.sh - it calls the others in order to install the various components.
install-pxe-server.sh contains the necessary configuration for the entire process. The configuration can be manipulated by changing the values of variables at the top of the file.

Because they installs software and do low-level configuration, the scripts need to run as root. Therefore, you should read them first. It's OK, they are short.
