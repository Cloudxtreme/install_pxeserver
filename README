This metapackage installs and configures the necessary packages to make a PXE server.
The server provides unpacked live CD images (that is, read-only file systems) via NFS. By default it's configured to provide Xubuntu Trusty.

The configuration of DHCP server and of NFS server is implemented in alternate config files.
This way the original configs need not be touched. rc-scripts will need to use -cf flag for dhcpd
