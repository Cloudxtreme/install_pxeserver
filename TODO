20140804 - Refactor script to use dpkg instead of apt-get to fetch and install packages, like so:
		apt-get --download-only download $PACKAGE
		dpkg --unpack $PACKAGE
		alter postinst.sh
		put it back together and install
	currently evaluating, this might not be such a good idea...

20141117 - above would be a premature optimization. Use metapackage to install packages, use postinst to 
set up config files & d/l images, etc. and bobs yr uncle.
